  "body": "**Abstract:**\r\n\tAn increasing tendency towards the application of Information Technology (IT) and the rapid and inevitable global propagation of E-commerce require the prediction of related legal mechanisms. Given that the E-transactions are virtual and incorporeal in nature, proving these transactions and the identity of the involved parties is one of the quite crucial points according to law. Proving this legal relationship requires obtaining the identity of parties and the integration of the incorporeal and virtual information content swapped in the electronic environment. Digital signature or other techniques of arithmetical cryptography, the subsets of electronic signature, make it possible. In fact, each signed document is authenticated and can be ascribed to someone to obligate him to its content. Hence, signature is not necessarily a particular figure or symbol, but each symbol or code elaborating on the individualâ€™s intention to do in a contract is acceptable in E-commerce. It must be admitted that electronic signature has legal effects of obtaining the identity of the document signatory and obligating him to its content like signing the manuscript. Some general points are made first on the digital electronic signature, including its concepts, methods for making it secure, and its advantages and disadvantages. Considering the challenges, the advantages and disadvantages of other presented algorithms in this domain (E.g. a modern algorithm for digital signature production based on residue numbers and uncommon molecular computing systems) are provided. A key is obtained first for encrypting the document in the proposed algorithm through extracting the properties of a document. The document is then transformed into a genetic environment and is mixed with the obtained key as a set of nucleoids. Using a private key composed of 128 nucleotides, the newly encrypted document is turned to its essence with 128 nucleotides regarding the private key. The document essence is finally encrypted with the help of residue numbers system and the (2n -1,2n,2n +1) module, the essence of the encrypted message is transferred to the genetic environment, and is applied as digital signature for the document in form of a sequence of nucleotides.\r\n\r\nKeywords: electronic signature, digital signature, electronic signature certificate, residue numbers system, DNA sequences, genetics\r\n",
